Async response
==============

List of normal responding methods:

* ``respondView``: responds view template file, with or without layout
* ``respondInlineView``: responds embedded template (not separate template file), with or without layout
* ``respondText("hello")``: responds a string without layout
* ``respondHtml("<html>...</html>")``: same as above, with content type set to "text/html"
* ``respondJson(List(1, 2, 3))``: converts Scala object to JSON object then responds
* ``respondJs("myFunction([1, 2, 3])")``
* ``respondJsonP(List(1, 2, 3), "myFunction")``: combination of the above two
* ``respondJsonText("[1, 2, 3]")``
* ``respondJsonPText("[1, 2, 3]", "myFunction")``
* ``respondBinary``: responds an array of bytes
* ``respondFile``: sends a file directly from disk, very fast
  because `zero-copy <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-zerocopy/>`_
  (aka send-file) is used
* ``respondEventSource("data", "event")``

Xitrum does not automatically send any default response.
You must explicitly call ``respondXXX`` methods above to send response.
If you don't call ``respondXXX``, Xitrum will keep the HTTP connection for you,
and you can call ``respondXXX`` later.

To check if the connection is still open, call ``channel.isOpen``.
You can also use ``addConnectionClosedListener``:

::

  addConnectionClosedListener {
    // The connection has been closed
    // Unsubscribe from events, release resources etc.
  }

Because of the async nature, the response is not sent right away.
``respondXXX`` returns
`ChannelFuture <http://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/channel/ChannelFuture.html>`_.
You can use it to perform actions when the response has actually been sent.

For example, if you want to close the connection after the response has been sent:

::

  import io.netty.channel.{ChannelFuture, ChannelFutureListener}

  val future = respondText("Hello")
  future.addListener(new ChannelFutureListener {
    def operationComplete(future: ChannelFuture) {
      future.getChannel.close()
    }
  })

Or shorter:

::

  respondText("Hello").addListener(ChannelFutureListener.CLOSE)

WebSocket
---------

::

  import scala.runtime.ScalaRunTime
  import xitrum.annotation.WEBSOCKET
  import xitrum.{WebSocketAction, WebSocketBinary, WebSocketText, WebSocketPing, WebSocketPong}

  @WEBSOCKET("echo")
  class EchoWebSocketActor extends WebSocketAction {
    def execute() {
      // Here you can extract session data, request headers etc.
      // but do not use respondText, respondView etc.
      // To respond, use respondWebSocketXXX like below.

      log.debug("onOpen")

      context.become {
        case WebSocketText(text) =>
          log.info("onTextMessage: " + text)
          respondWebSocketText(text.toUpperCase)

        case WebSocketBinary(bytes) =>
          log.info("onBinaryMessage: " + ScalaRunTime.stringOf(bytes))
          respondWebSocketBinary(bytes)

        case WebSocketPing =>
          log.debug("onPing")

        case WebSocketPong =>
          log.debug("onPong")
      }
    }

    override def postStop() {
      log.debug("onClose")
      super.postStop()
    }
  }

An actor will be created when there's request. It will be stopped when:

* The connection is closed
* WebSocket close frame is received or sent

Use these to send WebSocket frames:

* ``respondWebSocketText``
* ``respondWebSocketBinary``
* ``respondWebSocketPing``
* ``respondWebSocketClose``

There's no respondWebSocketPong, because Xitrum will automatically send pong frame
for you when it receives ping frame.

To get URL to the above WebSocket action:

::

  // Probably you want to use this in Scalate view etc.
  val url = webSocketAbsUrl[EchoWebSocketActor]

SockJS
------

`SockJS <https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client>`_ is a browser JavaScript
library that provides a WebSocket-like object, for browsers that don't support
WebSocket. SockJS tries to use WebSocket first. If that fails it can use a variety
of ways but still presents them through the WebSocket-like object.

If you want to work with WebSocket API on all kind of browsers, you should use
SockJS and avoid using WebSocket directly.

::

  <script>
    var sock = new SockJS('http://mydomain.com/path_prefix');
    sock.onopen = function() {
      console.log('open');
    };
    sock.onmessage = function(e) {
      console.log('message', e.data);
    };
    sock.onclose = function() {
      console.log('close');
    };
  </script>

Xitrum includes the JavaScript file of SockJS.
In your view template, just write like this:

::

  ...
  html
    head
      != jsDefaults
  ...

SockJS does require a `server counterpart <https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-protocol>`_.
Xitrum automatically does it for you.

::

  import xitrum.{Action, SockJsAction, SockJsText}
  import xitrum.annotation.SOCKJS

  @SOCKJS("echo")
  class EchoSockJsActor extends SockJsAction {
    def execute() {
      // To respond, use respondSockJsXXX like below

      log.info("onOpen")

      context.become {
        case SockJsText(text) =>
          log.info("onMessage: " + text)
          respondSockJsText(text)
      }
    }

    override def postStop() {
      log.info("onClose")
      super.postStop()
    }
  }

An actor will be created when there's a new SockJS session. It will be stopped when
the SockJS session is closed.

Use these to send SockJS frames:

* ``respondSockJsText``
* ``respondSockJsClose``

See `Various issues and design considerations <https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-node#various-issues-and-design-considerations>`_:

::

  Basically cookies are not suited for SockJS model. If you want to authorize a
  session, provide a unique token on a page, send it as a first thing over SockJS
  connection and validate it on the server side. In essence, this is how cookies
  work.

To config SockJS clustering, see :doc:`Clustering with Akka </cluster>`.

Chunked response
----------------

To send `chunked response <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding>`_:

1. Call ``setChunked``
2. Call ``respondXXX`` as many times as you want
3. Lastly, call ``respondLastChunk``

Chunked response has many use cases. For example, when you need to generate a
very large CSV file that does may not fit memory, you can generate chunk by chunk
and send them while you generate:

::

  // "Cache-Control" header will be automatically set to:
  // "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0"
  //
  // Note that "Pragma: no-cache" is linked to requests, not responses:
  // http://palizine.plynt.com/issues/2008Jul/cache-control-attributes/
  setChunked()

  val generator = new MyCsvGenerator

  generator.onFirstLine { line =>
    val future = respondText(header, "text/csv")
    future.addListener(new ChannelFutureListener {
      def operationComplete(future: ChannelFuture) {
        if (future.isSuccess) generator.next()
      }
    }
  }

  generator.onNextLine { line =>
    val future = respondText(line)
    future.addListener(new ChannelFutureListener {
      def operationComplete(future: ChannelFuture) {
        if (future.isSuccess) generator.next()
      }
    })
  }

  generator.onLastLine { line =>
    val future = respondText(line)
    future.addListener(new ChannelFutureListener {
      def operationComplete(future: ChannelFuture) {
        if (future.isSuccess) respondLastChunk()
      }
    })
  }

  generator.generate()

Notes:

* Headers are sent on the first ``respondXXX`` call.
* You can send optional trailing headers at ``respondLastChunk``
* :doc:`Page and action cache </cache>` cannot be used with chunked response.

Using chunked response together with ``ActorAction``, you can easily implement
`Facebook BigPipe <http://www.cubrid.org/blog/dev-platform/faster-web-page-loading-with-facebook-bigpipe/>`_.

Forever iframe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chunked response `can be used <http://www.shanison.com/2010/05/10/stop-the-browser-%E2%80%9Cthrobber-of-doom%E2%80%9D-while-loading-comet-forever-iframe/>`_
for `Comet <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29>`_.

The page that embeds the iframe:

::

  ...
  <script>
    var functionForForeverIframeSnippetsToCall = function() {...}
  </script>
  ...
  <iframe width="1" height="1" src="path/to/forever/iframe"></iframe>
  ...

The action that responds ``<script>`` snippets forever:

::

  // Prepare forever iframe

  setChunked()

  // Need something like "123" for Firefox to work
  respondText("<html><body>123", "text/html")

  // Most clients (even curl!) do not execute <script> snippets right away,
  // we need to send about 2KB dummy data to bypass this problem
  for (i <- 1 to 100) respondText("<script></script>\n")

Later, whenever you want to pass data to the browser, just send a snippet:

::

  if (channel.isOpen)
    respondText("<script>parent.functionForForeverIframeSnippetsToCall()</script>\n")
  else
    // The connection has been closed, unsubscribe from events etc.
    // You can also use ``addConnectionClosedListener``.

Event Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~

See http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/

Event Source response is a special kind of chunked response.
Data must be UTF-8.

To respond event source, call ``respondEventSource`` as many time as you want.

::

  respondEventSource("data1", "event1")  // Event name is "event1"
  respondEventSource("data2")            // Event name is set to "message" by default
