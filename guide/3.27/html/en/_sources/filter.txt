Action filters
==============

Before filters
--------------

Before filters are run before an action is run.
If a before filter responds something, all filters after it and the action will
not be run.

::

  import xitrum.Action
  import xitrum.annotation.GET

  @GET("before_filter")
  class MyAction extends Action {
    beforeFilter {
      log.info("I run therefore I am")
    }

    // This method is run after the above filters
    def execute() {
      respondInlineView("Before filters should have been run, please check the log")
    }
  }

After filters
-------------

After filters are run after an action is run.
They are functions that take no argument. Their return value will be ignored.

::

  import xitrum.Action
  import xitrum.annotation.GET

  @GET("after_filter")
  class MyAction extends Action {
    afterFilter {
      log.info("Run at " + System.currentTimeMillis())
    }

    def execute() {
      respondText("After filter should have been run, please check the log")
    }
  }

Around filters
---------------

::

  import xitrum.Action
  import xitrum.annotation.GET

  @GET("around_filter")
  class MyAction extends Action {
    aroundFilter { action =>
      val begin = System.currentTimeMillis()
      action()
      val end   = System.currentTimeMillis()
      val dt    = end - begin
      log.info(s"The action took $dt [ms]")
    }

    def execute() {
      respondText("Around filter should have been run, please check the log")
    }
  }

If there are many around filters, they will be nested.

Execution order of filters
--------------------------

* Before filters are run first, then around filters, then after filters.
* If one of the before filters returns false, the rest (including around and
  after filters) will not be run.
* After filters are always run if at least an around filter is run.
* If an around filter decide not to call ``action``, the inner nested
  around filters will not be run.
